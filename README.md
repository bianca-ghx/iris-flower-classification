# Iris Flower Classification

This project was developed to classify different iris flower species using machine learning techniques. The input data consists of measurements of iris flowers, and the purpose of this project is to implement an iris flower classification system using K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) and K-Means Clustering, along with Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for dimensionality reduction.

## Installation
To install and run this project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/bianca-ghx/iris-flower-classification.git
    ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```sh
    cd iris-flower-classification
    ```
3. Ensure you have Python and the required libraries installed.

## Usage
To use the iris flower classification system, follow these instructions:

1. Explore the dataset and initial visualizations in `data_exploration.ipynb`.
2. Implement and test KNN and K-Means clustering using `KNN_kMeans.ipynb`.
3. Apply PCA before classification using `PCA_kNN_kMeans.ipynb`.
4. Perform hyperparameter tuning with grid search in `PCA_kNN_kMeans_Grid.ipynb`.
